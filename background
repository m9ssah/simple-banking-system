Hello ^^

I initially created this project back in April 2023 for the sake of a highschool project. 
However, I have lost the original file, hence I am still working on fully debugging it (it is mostly finished, there are still some faulty commands though)

This project is essesntially an extremely simplified banking system which has four main functions:
creating a bank account/logging into it, depoiting money, withdrawing money, and viewing account information.

I would say that this project is heavily based around working with csv files and reading them overall.

I look forward to formally finishing this project ***for the second time D:***
